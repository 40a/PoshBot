# Roles

Roles are a collection of permissions.
Roles allow the bot administrator to construct a set of permissions from across many plugins that together control access to a set of related commands.
Perhaps you have several plugins installed that include commands that you want to grant to a Service Desk user.
You can create a role with only the permissions required for their job and nothing more.
Roles are **not** included with plugins.
The bot administrator creates roles and they are stored with the bot configuration.
